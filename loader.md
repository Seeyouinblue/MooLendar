# Data Mining Technique:

# k-Means Clustering

# DM ‚Äì Clustering

‚Ä¢ Clustering is a division of data into groups of similar objects.

‚Ä¢ Each group, called cluster, consists of objects that are similar between themselves and dissimilar objects of other groups. It represents many data objects by few clusters to achieve simplicity.

‚Ä¢ Difference between clustering and classification:

- Clustering corresponds to hidden patterns, it does not show how to define the clusters but need to be discovered by the analyst.
- Unsupervised learning and the resulting system represents a data concept

---
# Partitional Clustering

- Partitional clustering classifies data into k groups while each group must carry at least one data object and each object should belong to only one group.
- Data set are partitioned into k clusters based on the mean value of the objects in the cluster.
- One of the most popular algorithms for partitional clustering is the k-means clustering algorithm.
---
# Proximity Measures

- Clustering can be done by determining Similarity or Dissimilarity of the data
- Due to the different features of the data variables, the distance between two data objects ùëë(ùëñ, ùëó) needs to be determined in different ways (e.g. Manhattan distance)

# Different types of variables

- Categorical variables: E.g. Sex, Blood Type. Things that belong to these variables contain two or more categories but without intrinsic ordering to the categories
- Numerical variables: E.g. Weight, Height and Temperature. They are characterized by their Euclidean Distance equally difference among their nearest neighbors

# Similarity and Dissimilarity

‚Ä¢ Example: Use customers and income as a comparison

# Example: Membership Club

Marco Polo Club is the loyalty program of Cathay Pacific that is designed to reward our most valuable customers with benefits and services that enhance their travel experience.

There are four tiers in the club ‚Äì Green, Silver, Gold, and Diamond ‚Äì and each offers its members a range of privileges and benefits that make every journey something to look forward to.
---
# K-Means Clustering

Suppose Marco Polo Club has picked up a sample of nine customers to study their habits of flying with Cathay Pacific.

The table shows how much they fly with Cathay Pacific within a year.

|Member ID|Number of flights with Cathay Pacific per year|
|---|---|
|001|2|
|002|4|
|003|10|
|004|12|
|005|3|
|006|20|
|007|30|
|008|11|
|009|25|

To organize these numbers into two clusters (k=2), e.g. VIP and non-VIP.
---
# Steps 1 and 2

1. Two clusters named K1 and K2, respectively, are established and randomly assigned two means as m1 = 3 (ID: 005), m2 = 4 (ID: 002)
d(004,m1)=9
004
2. Find out the 1-dimensional distance between the objects and the mean values. Take Member 004 as an example:
d(004,m1) =
12-3
=9;
d(004,m2) =
12-4
=8;
Assign each object to the cluster with the mean closest to that object
|Member ID|Number of flights per year|d(i,m1)|d(i,m2)|Cluster|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|004|12|9|8|K2|
---
# Step 3

Repeat step 2 to find out the distance between the objects and the mean values for the rest of the members.

|Member ID|Number of flights per year|d(i,m1)|d(i,m2)|Cluster|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|001| | | |K1|
|002| | | |K2|
|003|10| | |K2|
|004|12| | |K2|
|005| | | |K1|
|006|20|17|16|K2|
|007|30|27|26|K2|
|008|11| | |K2|
|009|25|22|21|K2|

K1={001, 005}

K2={002, 003, 004, 006, 007, 008, 009}

14
---
# Steps 4 and 5

1. By using the value in K1 & K2, update the cluster means (m1 and m2)
|Member ID|Number of flights per year|d(i,m1)|d(i,m2)|Cluster|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|001|2|0.5|14|K1|
|002| |1.5|12|K1|
|003|10|7.5| |K2|
|004|12|9.5| |K2|
|005|3|0.5|13|K1|
|006|20|17.5| |K2|
|007|30|27.5|14|K2|
|008|11|8.5|5|K2|
|009|25|22.5| |K2|
2. Repeat step 2 after the means are renewed, result is shown in the table
- K1 = {001, 002, 005}
- K2 = {003, 004, 006, 007, 008, 009}
---
# Steps 6 and 7

1. Repeat steps 2-4, Stop when the means of the cluster no longer change anymore
2. The changes of the content of the clusters and means are:

The final result has identified 2 distinctive segments of people which fly with Cathay Pacific more than the other segment:

- Fly less with Cathay Pacific (K1): Member 001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 008
- Fly more with Cathay Pacific (K2): Member 006, 007, 009

# Problems in K-Means Clustering

- Sensitive to the initialization of cluster centroids
- ‚Üí Increase the number of iterations, or ‚Üí Obtain another clustering result

# Start

# Steps 1 and 2

Number of cluster K

1. Two clusters named K1 and K2, respectively, are established and randomly assigned two means as m1 = 3 (ID: 005), m2 = 4 (ID: 002)
2. Find out the I-dimensional distance between the objects and the mean values. Take Member 004 as an example:

d(004,m1) = /12-31-9;

d(004,m2) = /12-41-8;

# Centroid

|Member|Number|Distance objects to centroids|move group?|
|---|---|---|---|
|004| |K1|No object|

Grouping based on minimum distance

---
# K-Means++

‚Ä¢ Initialization of cluster centroids:

- Select the first centroid (C1) randomly, and the rest of the centroids based on the maximum squared distance.
- Calculate the distance between C1 and the rest of the data points (ùë• ‚àà ùëã), namely ùê∑(ùë•), while each data point is assigned with the probability of ùê∑(ùë•‚Ä≤)¬≤ / œÉùë•‚ààùëã ùê∑(ùë•)¬≤.
- Select the rest of the cluster centroid with the above probabilities.
- Proceed the standard k-means clustering algorithm.

---
# Distance Measure

Apart from the sum of the absolute distance (i.e. cityblock), other distance measures are available as follows:

|Distance Metric|Description|Formula|
|---|---|---|
|sqeuclidean|Squared Euclidean distance (default). Each centroid is the mean of the points in that cluster:|d(x, c) = (x - c)¬≤|
|cityblock|Sum of absolute differences; i.e. the L1 distance. Each centroid is the component-wise median of the points in that cluster.|d(x, c) = |x - c||
|cosine|One minus the cosine of the included angle between points (treated as vectors). Each centroid is the mean of the points in that cluster; after normalizing those points to unit Euclidean length.|d(x, c) = 1 - (x ¬∑ c) / (||x|| ||c||)|
|correlation|One minus the sample correlation between points (treated as sequences of values). Each centroid is the component-wise mean of the points in that cluster; after centering and normalizing those points to zero mean and unit standard deviation.|d(x, c) = 1 - (cov(x, c) / (std(x) * std(c)))|
|hamming|This metric is only suitable for binary data. It is the proportion of bits that differ: Each centroid is the component-wise median of points in that cluster.|d(x, y) = (1/n) * Œ£ (x_i ‚â† y_i)|

# Data Mining

# Technique:

# Association Rule Mining

---
# DM ‚Äì Association Rule Mining

- An association rule tries to discover links among the huge databases in different application areas particularly for business related activities such as selective marketing, decision analysis, and business management.
- Finds out items that are frequently purchased together in order to analyze the buying habits of customers, certain items are often bought in pairs.
- Discount can be given or put the items together in pairs to increase the income.

---
# Example: Duty-Free Shopping

‚Ä¢ Duty-free refers to exempting all taxes such as liquor tax, tobacco tax, customs duty, in addition to consumption tax.

‚Ä¢ The duty-free shop at the airport handles the duty-free item, so if you are a user of international flight, foreigners and residents of that country can use it.
---
# Association Rule Mining (ARM)

‚Ä¢ Association rules mining is to describe the relationship between different items that will appear at the same time.

‚Ä¢ The rule is composed of two parts: Antecedent and Consequence

A (Antecedent) ‚Üí B (Consequence)

‚Ä¢ Example: Red Wine ‚Üí Chocolate

‚Ä¢ It implies that the customer will buy red wine together with chocolate.

---
# Types of Association Rules

- If the co-occurrences often appear, these will be regarded as a rule. The rules are not always useful.

# Useful rules (E.g. Neck Cushion and Sensitive Skin Moisturizing Milk):

- Muji to GO has found that neck cushion is the item that is most frequently bought together with moisturizing milk (i.e. the rule sensitive skin moisturizing milk ‚Üí neck cushion).
- Market research has found that wives often remind their husbands to buy moisturizing milk when they are on their way home.
- 40% of husbands buy neck cushions for themselves together with moisturizing milk requested by their wives.
- As a result, the store has placed shelves for neck cushion near to the shelves for moisturizing milk so that the sales of both items recorded a 30% growth.
---
# Types of Association Rules

- Trivial rules (e.g. Notebook and Mouse):
- Results that are already known through common sense or by anyone at all familiar with the business.
- For instance, customers who purchase notebooks are very likely to purchase mouses: a trivial rule (notebook ‚Üí mouse).
- Inexplicable rules (e.g. Computer store and toilet bowl):
- Some results are not satisfactorily explained by the rules.
- It was found when a new computer store opened, that one of the most commonly items sold was toilet bowl cleaner.
- ‚ÄúNew computer store opens ‚Üí toilet bowl cleaner sold‚Äù, this only tells a fact but cannot provide any insight into consumer behavior or any suggestion for marketing strategies.
---
# Types of Association Rules

‚Ä¢ Only ‚Äúuseful‚Äù association rules, which contain high-quality and actionable information, can be interpreted and explained without spending too much effort.

‚Ä¢ After the rules are clearly identified, the company can gain more insights to take appropriate actions and establish marketing strategies.

---
# Basics of ARM

- Support (s): This is the percentage of records containing an item or a combination of items to the total number of records.
- Support (A) = P(A)
- Support (A ‚Üí B) = P(A B)
- The support is the probability of the presence of both A and B within the total transaction
- Inexplicable rules Confidence (c): This can reflect how sure we can be that a result with a certain combination of items will occur under a particular condition.
- Confidence (A ‚Üí B) = P(B|A) = Support (A ‚Üí B)/Support(A)
- Measure the ratio of A occurs together with B
---
# Basics of ARM

- For a typical association rule to be recognized as valid, the support and confidence of an association rule has to be equal to or larger than the minimum support threshold and the minimum confidence threshold respectively.
- Improvement (t): Tell how well the association rule predicts the result as compared with a single item set
- Confidence (A ‚Üí B)
- Improvement (t): Support ùê¥ ‚àó Support(ùêµ) = Confidence ùê¥‚Üíùêµ Support (ùê¥‚à™ùêµ) Support(ùêµ)
- When improvement is greater than 1, the resulting rule is good and suitable for prediction
- When improvement is less than 1 this means the rule is doing worse than informed guessing.
- Better predicting if the improvement is larger
---
# Simple Example of ARM

‚Ä¢ Suppose five customers have purchased various goods in a duty-free shop before flight.

|Transaction No.|Item bought|
|---|---|
|001|Souvenir, Orange Juice, Potato Chip, Beer|
|002|Orange Juice, Potato Chip|
|003|Souvenir, Beer, Potato Chip|
|004|Beer, Potato Chips|
|005|Orange Juice, Souvenir, Potato Chips|

---
# Simple Example of ARM

Based on the above information, an association rule can be constructed:

- For example: ‚ÄúIf a customer purchases beer, he/she will purchase souvenir as well.‚Äù (Rule: Beer ‚Üí Souvenir)

Support (Beer) = 3/5 = 60%

- 3 transactions containing beer out of the total five transactions

Confidence (Beer ‚Üí Souvenir) = 2/3 = 66.7%

- 2 transactions also containing souvenir out of 3 transactions containing beer

Improvement (Beer ‚Üí Souvenir) = Confidence (Beer ‚Üí Souvenir) / Support (Beer) = 0.667/0.6 = 1.1117

- Improvement (t) >1, the rule is useful as its ability to predict the result is stronger than guessing.

---
# Apriori Algorithm for ARM

‚Ä¢ How can we discover associate rules from a dataset?

‚Ä¢ Nine transactions are made in the supermarket, Apriori algorithm is used to find out any association rules based on the data recorded.

|Transaction ID|Items chosen in the transaction|
|---|---|
|001|A, B, E|
|002|B, D|
|003|B, C|
|004|A, B, D|
|005|A, C|
|006|B, C|
|007|A, C|
|008|A, B, C, E|
|009|A, B, C|

A. Beer

B. Snacks

C. Juice

D. Souvenirs

E. Soft drinks
---
# 1a. Transactional data of nine customers in the supermarket

are scanned to form such a table in order to find out the frequency of occurrence of different items in transactions (i.e. Support Counts ‚Äì s.c.)

|Items|Support Counts|
|---|---|
|A|6|
|B|7|
|C|6|
|D|2|
|E|2|

# 1b. Support counts are compared with the minimum support counts threshold

(min. s.c., is set to be 2 in this case). If s.c. < min. s.c., the corresponding items will be removed.
---
# 2a. Remaining items are merged to form an itemset

# 2b. Scan for support counts of there itemset

# 2c. Compare the s.c. of itemset with min. s.c. prune off the s.c. < min.

|Itemset|Support Counts|Itemset|Support Counts|
|---|---|---|---|
|AB|4|AB|4|
|AC|4|AC|4|
|AD|1|AE|2|
|AE|2|BC|4|
|BC|4|BD|2|
|BD|2|BE|2|
|BE|2|CD|0|
|CD|0|CE|1|
|CE|1|DE|0|
|DE|0| | |

---
# 3a. Generation of itemset with 3 items (i.e. 3-itemset).

Itemsets containing pruned parent itemset(s) are being pruned too

# 3b. Scan the transactional data for s.c. of each itemset

# 3c. Compare the s.c. of itemset with min. s.c.

|Steps|Itemset|Support Counts|Itemset|Support Counts|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| |ABC (AB, AC, BC)|2|ABC|2|
| |ABE (AB, AE, BE)|2|ABE|2|
| |BCD (BC, BD, CD)| | | |
| |BCD (BC, BE, CE)| | | |

# Find Useful Rules in n-itemsets

Taking 3-itemsets as the example as follows.

If the minimum confidence threshold is set to be 90%, then the possible rules that can be found:

6 transactions contains item C in totally nine transactions

4 contains both item A and B in totally nine transactions

|Condition|Result|Support (Condition)|Support (Result)|Support (Condition & Result)|Confidence|Improvement|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|A and B|B and C|4/9 - 44.4%|6/9 - 66.7%|2/9 - 22.2%|50.00%|0.75|
|A and C|B and C|4/9 - 44.4%|7/9 - 77.8%|2/9 - 22.2%|50.00%|0.64|
|B and C|B and C|4/9 - 44.4%|6/9 - 66.7%|2/9 - 22.2%|50.00%|0.75|

|ABC|A and C|6/9 - 66.7%|4/9 - 44.4%|2/9 - 22.2%|28.57%|0.64|
|ABC|A and B|6/9 - 66.7%|4/9 - 44.4%|2/9 - 22.2%|33.33%|0.75|
|A and B|A and B|4/9 - 44.4%|2/9 - 22.2%|2/9 - 22.2%|50.00%|2.25|

---
# Result Interpretation of ARM

- It is found that three rules‚Äô confidences exceed the required minimum confidence threshold (>90%)

- IF beer and soft drinks are bought, THEN snacks are bought together
- IF snacks and soft drinks are bought, THEN buy beer is bought together
- IF soft drinks are bought, THEN snacks and beer are bought together
---
# Support and Confidence Thresholds

- How to define the minimum support count?
- Lower the minimum support count, more association rules will be extracted
- Normally, support is around 25% ~ 30% (depends the size of the data)
- Confidence threshold is suggested to be more than 80%

# Text Mining

- Textual data cannot be effectively analysed by using data mining techniques
- Text mining, also known as text data mining, is the process of transforming unstructured text into a structured format to identify meaningful patterns and new insights.
- Same objective between data mining and text mining: ‚ÄúTo explore and discover hidden relationships within unstructured data‚Äù
---
# Motivation of Text Mining

- 80% of data in the world resides in an unstructured format (i.e. No pre-defined data format)
- Text mining tools and natural language processing (NLP) techniques are applied to transform unstructured data into a structured format for analysis and high-quality insights

# Text Visualisation: Word Cloud

‚Ä¢ Word Cloud: A visual representation of word frequencies. Higher the word frequency, larger the word to be visualised.

‚Ä¢ Tools (example): https://www.wordclouds.com/

‚Ä¢ Sample news: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/jdcom-strategy-why-chinese-e-commerce-giant-is-investing-in-gaming.html

‚Ä¢ Compatible with other languages and emoji
---
# Text Pre-Processing

Before analysing the texts, data pre-processing is important to extract useful words from raw datasets.

Similar to the extract, load, transform (ELT) process in the data pre-processing.

# Key approaches in the text pre-processing:

- a) Tokenization
- b) Stemming
- c) Lemmatization
- d) Stop-word removal
---
# Tokenization

‚Ä¢ Tokenization is the basic step in the entire text mining process to break text into a number of pieces, called ‚ÄúToken‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ In text mining, tokens refer to words. For example, a sentence of 10 words contains 10 tokens.

‚Ä¢ Tokenization is language-specific, and each language has its own tokenization requirements. English, for example, uses white space and punctuation to denote tokens, and is relatively simple to tokenize.
---
# Stemming

- Stemming is the process of producing a root/base word by removing prefixed and suffixes.
- For example,
- ‚Äúplays‚Äù, ‚Äúplayed‚Äù, ‚Äúplaying‚Äù to the root form ‚Äúplay‚Äù
- ‚Äúwalks‚Äù, ‚Äúwalked‚Äù, ‚Äúwalking‚Äù to the root form ‚Äúwalk‚Äù
- Stemming is the process of producing a root/base word by removing prefixed and suffixes.
---
# Lemmatization

Lemmatization is also the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base by considering the morphological meaning.

Tend to generate the words (listed in the dictionary)

For example,

- ‚Äúplays‚Äù, ‚Äúplayed‚Äù, ‚Äúplaying‚Äù to the root form ‚Äúplay‚Äù
- ‚Äúbetter‚Äù to the root form ‚Äúgood‚Äù

---
# Stop-Word Removal

- Stop words: the most common words in any language, e.g. articles, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, etc. ‚ûî low-level information
- Stop-word removal: reduce the textual dataset size and training time for the text analytics
- For example,
- ‚ÄúI love ISE328 teaching and materials‚Äù ‚ûî ‚Äúlove, ISE328, teaching, materials‚Äù
- Example: NLTK stopword list in the Python environment

---
# Bag-of-Words (BoW) Model

- BoW is a simple step to extract features from textual datasets for text analytics models
- A bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:
- A vocabulary of known words.
- A measure of the presence of known words.

# Using a histogram to present the BoW

# N-Gram Language Model

- N-gram is a sequence of N tokens (or words)
- 1-gram: ‚ÄúI‚Äù, ‚Äúlike‚Äù, ‚Äústudying‚Äù, ‚ÄúISE328‚Äù
- 2-gram: ‚ÄúI like‚Äù, ‚Äúlike studying‚Äù, ‚Äústudying ISE328‚Äù
- N-gram language model: learn the probability of word occurrence based on examples of text or the training data
- For example, P(ISE328 | I like) = Count(‚ÄúI like ISE328‚Äù)/Count(‚ÄúI like‚Äù)
- Bigram model: approximate the probability of a word given the previous word (with Markovian properties)

# Other IDF Weight Approaches (MATLAB)

- Normal ‚Äì For each term, set the IDF factor to ln(N/NT) [Used in the example]
- TextRank ‚Äì Use TextRank IDF weighting. For each term, set the IDF factor to
- ln((N-NT+0.5)/(NT+0.5)) if the term occurs in more than half of the documents
- IDFCorrection*avgIDF if the term occurs in half of the documents or f, where avgIDF is the average IDF of all tokens.
- BM25 ‚Äì For each term, set the IDF factor to ln((N-NT+0.5)/(NT+0.5)).
- Etc.

*where N is the number of documents in the input data and NT is the number of documents in the input data containing each term.

# Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

- A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that‚Äôs used for classification task, particular for the sentiment analysis (to determine whether the statement is positive, neutral, or negative).
- The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem:

ùëÉ(ùê¥|ùêµ) = ùëÉ(ùê¥|ùêµ)ùëÉ(ùê¥) / ùëÉ(ùêµ)

- In the Bayes theorem, the conditional probability P(A|B) can be expressed in the above formula as the backbone in the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier.

23
---
# Mechanism

- In the sentiment analysis, we aim to classify whether the new statement is positive or negative (class variables)

Based on the Bayes theorem, the probability of the class variable (y) given that a set of parameters/features (X) are provided:

P(y | X) = P(X | y) P(y) / P(X)

P(y | x1, ‚Ä¶ , xn) = P(x1 | y) P(x2 | y) ‚Ä¶ P(xn | y) P(y) / P(x1) P(x2) ‚Ä¶ P(xn)

There are n parameters/features

X = (x1, x2, x3, ‚Ä¶ , xn)

Since the denominator is static

P(y | x1, ‚Ä¶ , xn) ‚àù P(y) ‚àèi=1nP(xi | y)

# Key Result (max. probability of the class variable):

# y = argmaxyP(y) ‚àèi=1nP(xi | y)
- y = Class: positive/negative
- P(y) = Prior probability
- ‚àèi=1nP(xi | y) = Likelihood Probability

---
# Mechanism

- Prior probability: The percentage of the documents in each class
- Likelihood probability: To find the fraction of times of the specific parameters/features appears among all words in all documents of class y
- However, the probability for positive features in the negative class cannot be measured
- Laplace Smoothing Coefficient (e.g. a = 1) is considered when a specific word is not in the training dataset (V is the no. of dimensions/features in the data):

ùëÉ(ùë•ùëñ|ùë¶) = (count(ùë•i, ùë¶) + ùëé) / (œÉ ùë•ùëñ‚ààùëâcount(ùë•ùëñ,ùë¶)+ùëé) = (count(ùë•ùëñ,ùë¶) + ùëé) / (œÉx‚ààùëâ count(ùë•ùëñ,ùë¶) + ùëéùëâ)

# Example of the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

For the Comment 6: ‚ÄúGreat product‚Äù ‚Üí P(+ve|‚ÄùGreat Product‚Äù) & P(-ve|‚ÄùGreat Product‚Äù)

- Prior Probability:
- P(y = ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù) = 3/5 = 0.6
- P(y = ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù) = 2/5 = 0.4
- Likelihood Probability:
- P(‚ÄúGreat‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù) = (1 + 1)/(7 + 2*1) = 2/9
- P(‚ÄúProduct‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù) = (2 + 1)/(7 + 2*1) = 1/3
- P(‚ÄúGreat‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù) = (0 + 1)/(6 + 2*1) = 1/8
- P(‚ÄúProduct‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù) = (0 +1)/(6 + 2*1) = 1/8
- P(+ve|‚ÄùGreat Product‚Äù): P(y = ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù)* P(‚ÄúGreat‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù) * P(‚ÄúProduct‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù) = 0.6*2/9*1/3 = 0.0444
- P(-ve|‚ÄùGreat Product‚Äù): P(y = ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù)* P(‚ÄúGreat‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù) * P(‚ÄúProduct‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù) = 0.4*1/8*1/8 = 0.00625
- Therefore, argmax[P(y|‚ÄùGreat Product‚Äù)] = Positive (+ve)

# Example of the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

For the Comment 7: ‚ÄúUnsatisfactory service quality‚Äù

- Prior Probability:
- P(y = ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù) = 3/5 = 0.6
- P(y = ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù) = 2/5 = 0.4
- Likelihood Probability:
- P(‚ÄúUnsatisfactory‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù) = (0 + 1)/(7 + 2*1) = 1/9
- P(‚ÄúService‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù) = (1 + 1)/(7 + 2*1) = 2/9
- P(‚ÄúQuality‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù) = (0 + 1)/(7 + 2*1) = 1/9
- P(‚ÄúUnsatisfactory‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù) = (1 + 1)/(6 + 2*1) = 1/4
- P(‚ÄúService‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù) = (1 + 1)/(6 + 2*1) = 1/4
- P(‚ÄúQuality‚Äù | y = ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù) = (1 + 1)/(6 + 2*1) = 1/4
- P(+ve|‚ÄúUnsatisfactory service quality‚Äù): 0.6*1/9*2*9*1/9 = 0.00165
- P(-ve|‚ÄúUnsatisfactory service quality‚Äù): 0.4*1/4*1/4*1/4 = 0.00625

Therefore, argmax[P(y|‚ÄúUnsatisfactory service quality‚Äù)] = Negative (-ve)

- Limited Branding: You have less control over how your brand looks and feels compared to your own store.
- Competition: You compete directly with other sellers on the same platform, including the marketplace itself.
- Dependence on Marketplace Policies: You must follow the marketplace‚Äôs rules, which can change and affect your business.
- Data Access: You have limited access to customer data, making it harder to build direct relationships and customize marketing.
---
# Both are important

- Diversified Revenue Streams: By selling on both platforms, you reduce the risk of relying on a single   of income.
- Broader Reach: You can reach different segments of customers‚Äîthose who prefer shopping on marketplaces and those who prefer direct purchases.

# Designing e-Business

# 3 Levels in e-business direction:

1. Functions and features
2. e-Business Infra-Structure
3. e-Business Info-Structure
---
# Step 1. Functions and features

# First-level strategy

In designing your e-business, you have to take care of:

- Value Proposition (what you want to show?)

e.g. provide quality service, to be the pioneer, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
- Customer Segments (who your customers are?)

e.g. teenagers, adults, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
- Customer Priorities (what your customers want?)

e.g. convenient, fast, cheap, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
---
# Step 1. Functions and features

To create an innovative e-business design‚Ä¶.

# Q1. What business design can make your customer‚Äôs shopping and service experience unique and memorable?

- how you can impress your customers.
- how to use new technologies to surprise them.
- how to provide better services.
- how to meet your customer‚Äôs demand not only today but also in future.
---
# Step 1. Functions and features

To create an innovative e-business design‚Ä¶.

# Q2. What capabilities and competencies can create rich customer experiences?

- What features required to meet your customer‚Äôs need, after you understand/realize what they want.
- These decisions determine what your customer will see and encounter when interacting your e-business design.
- So, what techniques should be involved?

Case A - Counter
Case B - ATM
---
# Step 2. e-Business Infra-structure

# Second-level strategy

How do you structure your organization for efficiency?

- How to reduce the time of business process by using electronic equipment?
- How to improve the communication efficiency between departments?
- How to increase the data exchange efficiency between companies.

---
# Step 2. e-Business Infra-structure

For example: Apply RFID in Japanese restaurant
RFID tag
Payment with IC card
Scan the dishes
---
# Step 2. e-Business Infra-structure

You have to analyze your company‚Äôs structure.

- How many departments there, and their relationship.
- What functions each department want to have.
- Based on the software functionality/applications required to design your e-business.

- CRM
- ERP
- e-Procurement
- Financial Control
- Supply Chain Management

---
# Step 3. e-Business Info-structure

# Third-level strategy

- This is regarded as the structural foundation supporting the application layer.
- Web Servers, Database, ASP, etc.
- Ensure the applications are working, accessible and available.
- Reliability, security, etc.

# Three dimensions

- TRANSFORM BUSINESS CAPABILITIES: innovation and data leadership
- BUILD DIGITAL FRONTLINE: Customer experience and loyalty leadership
- MODERNISE TECHNOLOGY BACKBONE: Cost, quality and performance leadership

---
# Three dimensions-1

# Business capabilities and transformation

Emerging technologies are accelerating digital transformation, requiring business and process development and a forward-looking governance.

Business capabilities are the sum of all processes and assets (systems and data), including any supporting functions within the organisation.

Business capabilities are the key for developing the business and for utilising technology in the best possible way.

Transformation comprises of the parts and processes of an organisation that are engaged in improving business capabilities.

---
# Three dimensions-2

# Digital frontline

Digitalisation provides new business opportunities and requires consistent design thinking on how to face customers, partners and employees in a networked multi-channel world.

The digital frontline can be defined as any digital means that connects the company to the user and is visible to the user, whether the user is a customer or a partner, or whether the customer is internal or external.

Customer experience is at the heart of all digital frontline activities. Digital frontline is a crucial area as it is the key area where the emerging business focus and growth possibilities reside and where digital transformation happens through speed and agility.

Digital apps and web, as well as digital enterprises, enable the creation of new business possibilities around customer experience, digital business and internet of things (IoT) services.

---
# Three dimensions-3

# Technology backbone

Traditional information technology management function (or IT) needs to become the technology backbone that is responsible for development, and management of digital and administrative solutions in a professional way.

The technology backbone consists of all information technology systems and processes that support the running of the businesses operations, through the management of end-user services, plus enterprise and business applications.

It is where the essential business asset of a company resides, and the purpose is to provide operational efficiency to the company through reliability, security and scalability.

# What is IoT?

- from WIKIPEDIA

The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects‚Äî‚Äúthings‚Äù‚Äîthat are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.

- from IOT Agenda

The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

2. Utilize the fuzzy integral value ranking method to obtain the rank of each ERP project.
3. Analyze the results. Observe the change in the final ERP suitability and the final ranking value.
4. Select the ERP project with the maximum ranking value.
5. Implement the selected ERP project.


---
# What is Network Security

Network security consists of the policies and practices adopted to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible re s. Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users choose or are assigned an ID and password or other authenticating information that allows them access to information and programs within their authority.
---
# Network Security Coverage

Network security covers a variety of computer networks, both public and private, that are used in everyday jobs: conducting transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals. Networks can be private, such as within a company, and others which might be open to public access.

Network security is involved in organizations, enterprises, and other types of institutions. It does as its title explains: it secures the network, as well as protecting and overseeing operations being done. The most common and simple way of protecting a network re  is by assigning it a unique name and a corresponding password.
---
# Importance

In the present day world, everyone benefits from advanced cyber defense programs. Network security is extremely essential because it encompasses everything that includes protecting:

- Our sensitive data,
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
- Protected Health Information (PHI),
- Personal information,
- Intellectual property data

---
# Common Types of Cyber-Attacks

# Malware

Malware ‚ÄúMalicious Software‚Äù is developed by a cyber-attacker with the purpose of invading the target‚Äôs computer and taking some or full control.
Usually, Malware can infect the system or network with the initial unintentional and unknowing help from a human and continue to self-replicate automatically. Once security is breached and the Malware is in the system, it can do serious damage.

---

# Phishing

A cyber-attack that aims to obtain sensitive information by cheating targets into believing fake messages.
Phishing attackers disguise themselves as a trustworthy and send lures usually through email, social media, or other electronic media.

---
# Man in the Middle Attack (MITM)

MITM attempts to secretly intercept and listen to the legitimate communication between two hosts.

# Most Common Types:

- Email Hijacking
- Wireless LAN Eavesdrop
- Session Hijacking

---
# DoS and DDoS

‚Ä¢ Denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network re  unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or re  with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.

‚Ä¢ In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single. (HTTP Flood is the variation of DDoS)

---
# Cross Site Scripting

- This attack aims to insert malicious code into a website which targets a visitor‚Äôs browser.
- Cross Site Scripting, also known as XSS, targets trusted web applications. The attacker uses the web app to inject the code such as browser or client-side scripts that is viewed by other users of the same application.

- Process: 
1. Perpetrator discovers website having a vulnerability that enables script injection. 
2. Perpetrator injects the website with a malicious script that steals each visitors session cookies. 
3. For each visit to the website, the malicious script is activated. 
4. Visitors session cookie is sent to perpetrator.

---
# SQL Injection Attack (SQLi)

- An SQL injection attack interferes with the queries that a web application makes to the database. 
- An attacker inserts crafted SQL (Structured Query Language) code lines that allow data to be revealed.

-Process: 
1. Hacker identifies vulnerable, SQL-driven website & injects malicious SQL query via input data.
2. Malicious SQL query is validated & command is executed by database. 
3. Hcker is granted access to view and alter records or potentially act as database administrator. 

---
# Zero-day Exploits

- The term ‚Äúzero-day‚Äù refers to the day when a new vulnerability is discovered by a software vendor. From that moment, of zero-day detection, the clock is ticking for the software vendor to produce a patch as quickly as possible. Once a patch is produced, the software‚Äôs end users must install and verify the patch and security vendors must update their attack detection signatures and push those updates to their tools.

- Process: 
1. VULNERABILITY INTRODUCED: EXPLOIT RELEASED
2. ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITY DISCOVERED
3. VULNERABILITY DISCLOSED
4. VENDOR DEVELOPS FIX A 
5. VENDOR RELEASES A FIX / PATCH: ATTACLK SIGNATURES RELEASED
6. PATCH DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE & VERIFIED

# What is Digital Money

- Electronic money is money which exists only in banking computer systems and is not held in any physical form.
- Electronic money, or e-money, is the money balance recorded electronically on a stored-value card.
- It may refer to several systems which enable a buyer to pay electronically by transmitting a unique number (called digital certificate) similar to a banknote number.

‚Ä¢ In economic terms electronic money is monetary value provided by the issuer on demand, expressed in government or private monetary units stored in electronic form on an electronic device.

‚Ä¢ Both virtual currencies and cryptocurrencies are types of digital currencies, but the converse is incorrect.

---
# History

In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called ecash. In 1995, David Chaum implemented it through Digicash. In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled *How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash*, describing a Cryptocurrency system. In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", characterized as an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.

In 2009, The first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created.

In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult.

In October 2011, Litecoin was released. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use scrypt as its hash function.

On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had been commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies. 

---
# Cryptocurrencies

A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the currency.

Cryptocurrencies are a subset of alternative currencies, or specifically of digital currencies.

There were more than 710 cryptocurrencies available for trade in online markets as of 11 July 2016, but only 9 of them had market capitalizations over $10 million.

# Four different systems

- Centralized Systems
- Decentralized Systems
- Mobile sub-systems/Digital Wallets
- Offline Anonymous Systems

---
# Centralized Systems

- Many systems‚Äîsuch as PayPal, eCash, WebMoney, Payoneer, cashU, and Hub Culture's Ven will sell their electronic currency directly to the end user.
- Other systems only sell through third party digital currency exchangers

---
# Decentralized Systems

Decentralized e-money is stored and flows through a peer-to-peer computer network that directly links users, much like a chat room. No single user controls the network.

# Some decentralized types:

- Bitcoin
- Monero
- Litecoin
- Ripple Monetary System
- Dogecoin
- Nxt
---
# Bitcoin

- Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, who published the invention in 2008 and released it as open-  software in 2009.
- The system is peer-to-peer; users can transact directly without needing an intermediary.
- Transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the block chain.
- The ledger uses bitcoin as its unit of account. The system works without a central repository or single administrator, which has led the U.S. Treasury to categorize bitcoin as a decentralized virtual currency.
- Bitcoin is often called the first cryptocurrency.
---
# Mobile sub-systems/Digital Wallets

- A number of electronic money systems use contactless payment transfer in order to facilitate easy payment and give the payee more confidence in not letting go of their electronic wallet during the transaction.
- On September 9th, 2014 Apple Pay was announced at the iPhone 6 event. In October 2014 it was released as an update to work on iPhone 6 and Apple Watch. It is very similar to Google Wallet, but for Apple devices only.
---
# Mobile sub-systems/Digital Wallets

- GNU Taler is an anonymous, open   electronic payment system currently (September 2015) in development
- BKasH is the leading payment system in Bangladesh

# Offline Anonymous Systems

- It can be done ‚Äòoffline‚Äô.
- In this electronic money system, the merchants do not need to have interaction with banks before receiving currency from the users. Instead of that, the merchants can collect spent money by users and deposits the money later to the bank.
- The merchant can deliver his storage media in bank for exchanging the electronic money to cash.

# GEQ Virtual Collaboration

# What is Virtual collaboration

Virtual collaboration is the method of collaboration between virtual team members that is carried out via technology-mediated communication.

Virtual collaboration follows the same process as collaboration, but the parties involved in virtual collaboration do not physically interact and communicate exclusively through technological channels.

Distributed teams use virtual collaboration to simulate the information transfer present in face-to-face meetings, communicating virtually through verbal, visual, written, and digital means.

---
# Three Characteristics

Sharing of information: Virtual collaboration is meant to enable the sharing of knowledge between parties who cannot exchange information due to physical separation. Virtual collaboration platforms allow the transfer of different types of information between collaborators to work towards a common goal.

Dispersed Collaborators: Collaborators within virtual collaboration are physically separated from each other and can only interact virtually. Being able to physically interact with a team member affords many benefits that virtual collaboration cannot provide, and eliminates any need for virtual meetings (sharing of context, interpersonal relationships, etc.).

Technology-mediated: Because virtual collaborators cannot interact physically they use technology to share information over several mediums. Most virtual collaboration platforms are carried out via the internet, for example email, video conferencing, and virtual workspaces.

---
# Two Types

- Synchronous collaboration occurs when team members are able to share information and ideas instantaneously.

Examples: instant messaging, chat rooms, and video or audio conferencing.

- Asynchronous collaboration occurs when team members communicate without the ability to instantly respond to messages or ideas.

Examples: e-mail, discussion boards, application-specific groupware, or shared databases.

---
# Advantages

# Pooling of expertise:

Virtual collaboration provides more opportunities for experts to join project groups where their knowledge can be best used, and be complemented with other experts whose knowledge contributes to a common goal.

Virtual collaboration allows teams to be formed based on subject and expertise, without the restriction of physical proximity of collaborators. The pool of expertise is much greater abroad than in most local team settings, meaning that virtual collaboration gives teams an opportunity to add a quality expert that fits the needs of the team.

This can be proved by the fact that dispersed teams with recruited experts tend to have higher net earnings than local teams with a local expert.

# Cost effective:

Compared to face-to-face meetings of distributed group members, virtual collaboration is much less costly. The time and costs associated with transportation to physically bring together team members from different geographic locations can be substantially higher than the cost of a virtual collaborative application.

Software used to connect distributed teams can be found for free on the internet, with more feature-loaded and specialized applications having a one-time cost or a paid subscription.

---
# Disadvantages

- Lower Group Potency: ineffective discussion
- Reduced Cohesiveness
- Poor Satisfaction
- Technological limits
- Reliance on Technology
- Asynchronous and lagged communication
- Means of exclusion: choose to receive certain information

---
# Challenges

- Technology-related challenges

The team needs to have knowledge of both the nature of their work and the virtual collaboration media they choose, and select the best suited media to deal with the most suitable situation. The team also need the skill to deal with the media to overcome issues coming from the media.

- Cultural diversity-related challenges

The team members need to have good knowledge on cultural differences between members and the knowledge of choosing the proper media to smooth these differences. The members are expected to have the skill to adjust their communication behavior and the language proficiency to achieve cultural adaption.

- Trust-related challenges

Trust between members of virtual teams affects the quality and amount of shared information. When virtual teams meet face-to-face, it creates trust and cohesion and ensures knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing in virtual teams influences the formation of trust and contributes to the effectiveness of the team. In written communication one cannot be sure about other members‚Äô commitment and it is difficult to recognize others‚Äô emotions.

- Geographic dispersion-related challenges

The team member should clearly understand pros and cons of choosing synchronous and asynchronous medias to avoid issues resulted from dispersed workplaces. The skill of time and self-management of team members are also emphasized to overcome this challenge.

- Time-related challenges

If a virtual project is only a small part of the team members' job, members may not have enough time for the virtual project. Thus, for example, they have to process information fast. A particular challenge in virtual teams is following through and responding at a right time because not responding could be interpreted as a lack of competence or commitment.

# Transaction Types in E-Commerce Businesses

- Business-to-Business (B2B)
- Business-to-Customer (B2C)
- Business-to-Business-to-Customer (B2B2C)
- Customer-to-Business (C2B)
- Customer-to-Customer (C2C)

---
# Business-to-Business (B2B)

B2B e-Commerce is defined as the sales of goods or services between businesses via online channels, instead of traditional ways, such as telephone and mail.

Transactions are carried out digitally, which helps reduce a great amount of overhead costs.

B2B transactions tend to happen in the supply chain, where one company will purchase raw materials from another to be used in the manufacturing process.

Example of the B2B business relationship: Apple ‚Üí Intel, Panasonic, and semiconductor companies etc.
---
# Business-to-Customer (B2C)

‚Ä¢ Business-to-consumer refers to the process of businesses selling products and services directly to consumers, with no middleperson.

‚Ä¢ B2C is typically used to refer to online retailers who sell products and services to consumers through the Internet.

‚Ä¢ Online B2C can be broken down into 5 categories:

- Direct sellers
- Online intermediaries, e.g. Expedia and Trivago
- Advertising-based B2C
- Community-based, e.g. Facebook
- Fee-based, e.g. Netflix

---
# Business-to-Business-to-Customer (B2B2C)

- B2B2C is an e-commerce model that combines business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) for a complete product or service transaction in a mutually beneficial manner.
- A business developing a product, service or solution partners with another business to use a particular service, such as an e-commerce website, portal or blog. The two business combine forces and promote mutually beneficial products, services and/or solutions.

---
# Customer-to-Business (C2B)

- C2B allows customers to provide a business with a service, from which the consumer makes a profit.
- This is the reverse of the typical business-to-consumer model (or B2C), in which a company provides a service to customers through the sale of goods and services.
- Example: programming/development work, reverse auction, affiliate marketing, advertisement etc.
---
# Customer-to-Customer (C2C)

- Customer to customer (C2C) is a business model that enables customers to trade with each other, frequently in an online environment.
- C2C businesses are a type of business model that emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.
- Online C2C company sites include Craigslist, Etsy, and eBay, which sell products or services through a classified or auction system.
- A market environment is built where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction.
---
# Omnichannel E-Commerce is on the rise

- Traditional: The good, old-fashioned bricks and mortar store
- E-Commerce: Online shopping has skyrocketed in recent years
- Multichannel: Various, disconnected channels for customers to use independently

# E-commerce Business Revenue Models

- Direct to Consumer (D2C): In the D2C model, there is no middleman; instead, businesses sell rights to consumers, like Warby Parker and their prescription eyeglasses. This model builds customer loyalty quickly, as they are better able to customize the user experience.
- Subscription Service: Subscription services are convenient for customers, and businesses can easily use subscription services to sell additional products. Examples include membership-based e-commerce platforms, streaming services, or premium content subscriptions.
- Advertising Model: E-commerce companies can generate revenue by displaying advertisements on their platform. They can charge advertisers for ad placements, clicks, or impressions, leveraging the user base and traffic they attract.
- Value-Added Services Model: E-commerce companies can offer additional services such as fulfillment, logistics, customization, or extended warranties, charging customers for these value-added services on top of the product price.

# Introduction

The rapid development of 3D printing industry:

- in terms of the increased industry size, further segmented Industrial market, the focus shifting towards the more profitable mid- and downstream service sectors


# The difficulties in intellectual property rights (IPRs) protection
- Time consumed to authorising the rights
- Difficulties to realising the profit
- Low efficiency of protecting the rights

- The digital data, like the 3D printing design, characterised as large amount of data, real-time, rely heavily on the electronic devices, easy to tamper and lose etc., making it more difficult to store as evidence for intellectual property rights.

# Phase 1 Study: Industrial Needs

# Insights from the interviews

- Potential issues from current IP Law ‚Äì illegal usage activities of IP:
Easy access to obtain digital content and print
Serious brand dilution
Hard to detect infringement
Difficult for company to track for counterfeiting and tracing the origins of source materials

- Lack of IP standards and regulation in the industry
- High workload, time consuming, and costly to gain IP
- Conflicts between innovation and business opportunity
- Collision when old laws meet new ecosystem
- Complicated IP law on 3DP

- There was no real support for a sui generis (new 3DP) style right
- Some companies are completely ignorant of IPR (50-50 I would say on our interviews)
- Others are interested, but mainly in patents
- Around 10-20% were already interested in watermarking technologies
- Those involved in medical devices are most knowledgeable of the law

# Areas for Improvement

To tackle the above issues, several areas have been identified that could be improved further: licensing platforms particularly; the legal circumstances concerning 3D printed content could be overcome.

---

# Phase 2 Study: Digital Watermarking

# 1) Pre-processing

# 2) Watermark pattern generation

# 3) Watermark embedding

# Process flow of 3D printing (3DÊâìÂç∞Â∑•Ëâ∫ÊµÅÁ®ã)
1. CAD
2. STL convert
3. File transfer to machine
4. Machine setup
5. Build
6. Remove
7. Post-process
8. Application

# Our Patented Approach

- Watermark information is added into the original 3D digital model, which is kept by the designer and not distributed
- Making small, imperceptible changes to the model
- Objects are printed with ‚Äúwatermark‚Äù (i.e., changes)
- Will not affect the overall feature and functionality of the design

- These changes are recorded as a key by the designers
- Designers can have different keys corresponding to different customers
- Data can be traced (i.e., become big data)

- The coordinates of pre-determined key points from both the original and watermarked 3D models are extracted
- Their differences are calculated by a specific algorithm and then plotted as a variance graph
- The variance graph is unique for the specific pair of original and watermarked digital model
- When the design is printed, the watermark stays with the printed physical objects

---
# Phase 2 Study: Digital Watermarking

# Our Patented Approach

- The globe coordinates of all the key points of the original 3D model, x, y, zi are exported and recorded
- Then a matrix representing the original model is obtained

# Introduction

- Maritime Economy: National strategic plan
- Ports: an important pillar of marine economic development
- Intermodal transportation: the main form of international multimodal transport, which has the characteristics of low price, convenient, flexible and stable transportation

- A hub city linked by sea and land
- Strategic focus city for innovative development of marine economy in the 13th five year plan
- The merge of the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port
  An international shipping service platform integrating port shipping, logistics, shipping agency, finance, insurance and other functions
---
# Introduction

The intelligent and information service industry of Ningbo-Zhoushan port is still in its infancy:

- Port operation: the independent and decentralised information system leads to "information silos‚Äù
- Business management system: inconsistent database standards lead to inconsistent information resource  base
- Information platform: limited to a single industry, shipping and land transportation are relatively independent, and two-way connection has not been achieved
- The establishment of sea and land logistics booking and tracking system cannot be separated from the support of electronic logistics information system
- But there are still problems such as slow development process, inconsistent logistics standards among different logistics enterprises, and limited flexibility of suppliers
- The relatively independent sea and land logistics standards lead to differences in the evaluation criteria of the information system of the sea and land logistics enterprises
- There is a lack of an information system evaluation system suitable for both sea and land transportation
- It is very important to build an evaluation system of logistics information system suitable for sea land combined transportation to assist the system design and meet market expectations

---
# One-stop sea and land logistics reservation and tracking system

# Objectives:

- Understand the current booking process of sea and land transportation
- Explore the factors that affect the adoption of electronic reservation and tracking systems by different enterprises in the industry
- Based on the above, to develop an electronic reservation and tracking system

# One-stop sea and land logistics reservation and tracking system

# Insights:

- Some shipping companies have developed and launched one-stop booking and tracking platforms
- But such platforms are only used in the field of shipping
- Sea and land transportation belong to different fields, and the shipping space and means of transportation (ship, train, automobile) are operated by different enterprises
- It is still difficult to realise the booking and tracking activities of through one platform
- Requires multi-party coordination of the industry
- Such platforms need a lot of data to support

# Objectives:

- Comparison of time series methods for container throughput prediction
- Develop a hybrid time series prediction model based on SARIMA and SVR
- Explore the applications of new technology in marine supply chain

# Comparison of time series methods for container throughput prediction:

- Ningbo port as the research object
- The accuracy of different prediction models on the port throughput data is compared
- Data: Historical data of Ningbo port container throughput from the Ningbo statistical yearbook
- Training set to validation set: 80:20 (Deo et al., 2016; Al-Musaylh et al., 2018)
- The validation set is used to verify the prediction model obtained from the training set

- Six time series prediction models are used to mine and verify the same container throughput time series data:
- Moving Average (MA)
- Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS)
- Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Grey Model GM(1,1)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Take the throughput of the previous years as the input variable to predict the throughput of the next year

# Comparison of time series methods for container throughput prediction:

|Models|ME|RMSE|MAE|MPE|MAPE|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|MA|346.17|377.90|346.17|17.96|17.96|
|MARS|107.38|120.03|107.38|5.55|5.55|
|ARIMA|49.06|74.43|61.71|2.39|3.14|
|GM(1,1)|-257.89|266.88|257.89|-13.58|13.58|
|SVR|14.91|44.30|44.25|0.63|2.38|
|ANN|108.44|162.14|133.40|5.29|6.78|

# Analysis of hinterland competitiveness and prediction of port throughput

# Comparison of time series methods for container throughput prediction:

- Insights:
 - The prediction accuracy of MARS and ARIMA, two traditional regression methods, are significantly better than that of MA and GM (1,1)
 - In addition, the prediction performance of ARIMA is better than MARS
 - ANN performs worse than SVR, ARIMA and MARS
 - Obviously , SVR has advantages in dealing with nonlinear problems such as container throughput prediction, especially the data scale of this study is relatively small

# Hybrid time series prediction model based on SARIMA and SVR: 

# Insights:

- The prediction accuracy can be improved by adding Gaussian white noise to the learning model
- Gauss white noise and SARIMA's results together cannot improve the results
- Incorporating the results of SARIMA into the prediction model does not improve the accuracy

# Container transportation route selection based on multi modal transportation

# Introduction:

- The first step to find the optimal path is to determine the optimisation objectives
- There are three optional optimisation objectives, namely, the optimal cost, the shortest time, and the pareto optimisation considering both time and cost
- The optimisation goal here can be provided to end users to choose the optimisation goal they want

# 3. Organizational:

# Outsourcing Management

- Today‚Äôs business climate demands companies to be flexible in order to survive.
- It forces companies to out  specific business processes in order to improve the overall business performance, called Business process outsourcing (BPO).
- Traditionally, outsourcing is a cost-control technique.
- Today, outsourcing is for quality improvement.
- Outsourcing always takes about some parts that you are not strong/specialize on.
- Then you out  it in order to improve the product quality.

# Contract manufacturing
- Usually used by those companies, if their capital is very tight, or if they don‚Äôt want to spend much money in install the machines, building a factory, order too urgent, etc.
- Companies only focus on the designing the core/key component and subcontract other to suppliers.
- This can help them to increase their flexibility.
- To move them from capital/asset-intensive focus to knowledge-intensive one.

e.g. Limit capacity

If a shoes manufacturer has to produce 1000 pair of shoes, but its production capacity can produce only 600 unit, then it can contract out to other manufacturers.

# Virtual distribution
- A new intermediary , like a virtual company
- These companies aggregate buyers and sellers by using Web technology.

# Difference between e-commerce and e-business

# Argument

There is no Exact definition in defining the meaning and limitations of both e-commerce and e-business.

Researchers and ICTs experts are arguing on this topic.

Rayport and Jaworksi (2003): ‚Äúe-commerce includes the entire world of electronically based organizational activities that support a firm‚Äôs market exchanges ‚Äì including a firm‚Äôs entire Information System‚Äôs infrastructure‚Äù.

Kalakota and Robinson (2003) ‚Äúe-business encompasses the entire world of internal and external electronically based activities, including e-commerce‚Äù.

---
# Difference between e-commerce and e-business

We adopt this idea: 
Laudon and Traver (2007): 
They proposed that ‚Äúit is important to make a working distinction between e-commerce and e-business because they refer to different phenomena‚Äù.

# e-business (1)

It refers primarily to the digital enablement of activities and processes within a company. 
e.g. Information systems under the control of the company.

---
# Difference between e-commerce and e-business

# e-business (2)

It does not include commercial transactions across the company‚Äôs boundaries. 
It will not directly generate revenue for the company from outside the company‚Äôs boundaries. 
e.g. a company‚Äôs online inventory control system is a component of e-business, you will not generate revenue from it.

# e-commerce

Includes commercial transactions across the company‚Äôs boundaries. 
It will directly generate revenue for the company from outside the company‚Äôs boundaries.

---
# What is transaction?

Transactions are exchanges that occur when one economic entity sells a product or service to another entity. In e-commerce, a transaction should involve money. Can generate revenue.
---

# Difference between e-commerce and e-business

# Which services are regarded as e-commerce?

Providing Information

- Simply providing information to customer alone is NOT e-commerce.

e.g. Checking balance, request e-statement, etc.


e-Commerce

- Generate revenue for company.

e.g. Buying stock, money transfer (with service charges), etc.

# Seven unique features of e-business technology

1. Ubiquity
2. Global reach
3. Universal standards
4. Information Richness
5. Interactivity
6. Information Density
7. Personalization/Customization
---

# Seven unique features of e-business technology

# 1. Ubiquity

It means just available everywhere, at all times. e-Business technology moves the marketplace from traditional physical space to your desktop / mobile / etc. Ubiquity reduces the transaction costs, mainly in the cost of participating in a market.

e.g. Think about the ways of checking the balance of your bank account.


# 2. Global reach

e-Business technology permits commercial transactions to cross cultural and national boundaries far more conveniently and cost effectively. The potential market size for e-commerce merchants is roughly equal to the size of the world‚Äôs online population.

e.g. As we mentioned before, whoever has a computer and can access Internet can be your customer. In contrast, most traditional commerce is local or regional.


# 3. Universal standards (common platform)

It refers to the technical standards of the Internet. The universal technical standards of Internet and e-commerce greatly lower market entry cost, meaning the cost just to bring their goods to market. It also reduces the search costs that the effort required to find the suitable products.


# 4. Information Richness

Information Richness refers to the complexity and content of a message. It refers to the personal, face-to-face service provided when making a sale. Traditional markets make good use of them to increase their selling power.

e.g. Buying a digital camera

- When you go to buy a digital camera in some shop in person, the salesperson in the shop will usually ‚Äúnicely‚Äù explain the features and functions of the product, letting you play around with different camera models. You can ask questions and their opinions about the camera.

However, since the larger the audience reached, the less rich the message. A trade-off between richness and reach should be made.

e.g. Buying digital camera

- If you buy it online, no salesperson will come to service you.
- This is one of the disadvantages in doing e-commerce.
- When you do business, you have to realize that whether your customers can purchase the product online or not. If your products can also be purchased online, then you have to provide much better customer services to attract them to shop.


# 5. Interactivity

e-Commerce technology allows for two-way communication between merchant and consumer.

Television, for example, cannot ask viewers any questions or enter into conversations with them.

In contrast, all of these activities are possible on an e-commerce Web site.

Interactivity allows an online merchant to engage a consumer in ways similar to face-to-face experience.

e.g.

- Internet conferencing, internet phone, e-mail, etc.
- However, this information richness still may not be as good as traditional approach.


# 6. Information Density

e-business technologies reduce cost in information collection, storage, processing, and communication. In the mean time it also increases the currency, accuracy and timeliness of information.

e.g. The old way to share information‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Paper, Mail, Voice


# 6. Information Density

making information more useful and important than ever. In e-commerce market, therefore, prices and costs become more transparent.

e.g. Comparing Prices

- Strictly speaking, this fast spreading of information feature is because of the advantage of the Internet.
- Getting the idea of the price of a iPod Nano.


# 7. Personalization/Customization

e-Business technologies permit personalization. Merchants can target their marketing messages to specific individuals by adjusting the message to a person‚Äôs name, interests, and past purchases record.

e.g. Nike enables consumers to design their own pair of personalized shoes by allowing consumers to specify the colors for the various shoe parts.

e.g. More example:

For customers:

You can set your preference to include the things or news that you are interested in.


For companies:

They can categorize their customers according to their buying habits, age groups, academic background, etc. and deliver some special or tailor-made promotion to them.

For customization, user‚Äôs preferences or behavior can be changed as desired.

# Case Study: Container Terminals

# Functions of Terminals

- Provide parking place for vessels.
- Helping the vessels to unload / upload containers.

# Locations

TSING YiISIANM

Rambler channel

# Terminals

- HIT terminals
- terminal 6 & 7
- terminal (East)
- Kwai Chung terminal

# Additional Features

- Traffic view cam
- Virtual tour
---
# Case Study: Container Terminals

# A Simple Operation flow of the Terminal (1):

- Once a vessel (full of containers) arrives the Terminal.
- First, it will be assigned to park in one of the berths.
- Then the terminal will use the Quay cranes to lift the containers and load it to the Internal Tractors.

Quay Cranes are designed to provide fast loading and discharging container to/from large ocean vessels. They are built to handle panamax and post-panamax size vessels.

These vehicles pull trailers, which in turn transport the containers.

---

# Case Study: Container Terminals

The Mainframe computer will then determine where the container should be placed in the yard according to the heuristics rules that they defined.

- Then the Internal tractor will carry the container to the particular place
- Container will be unloaded by Rubber-tyred gantry crane (Rubber crane) or Rail-mounted gantry crane (Rail crane).

- The RTGCs run on rubber tyre wheels. The speed and the operating efficiency are relatively lower than the RMGCs because they are manually operated. However, RTGCs are more flexible to use because they can move from block to block.
- The container will then be stacked.

The RMGCs are highly automated with stacking capability by adopting the laser guidance technology. They move automatically over the rail with high speed and thus achieve better operating efficiency.


When this container is about to leave the Terminal:

- An External tractor will enter the Terminal.
- Passing the gates and wait in the yard for further instructions.

---
# Case Study: Container Terminals

- When the container is ready for pick-up, then the driver will be acknowledged by a mobile message sent by the Terminal.
- The voicemail is in three different languages, such as Chinese, English, and Mandarin.
- This service called ‚ÄúMobile Container Movement Slip‚Äù (CMS).
- HIT teams up with Orange (mobile phone service provider) to offer the system.


# Advantages

- Reduces the time in acknowledging the driver about location.
- Drivers do not need to go to collect the notification from the HIT‚Äôs Despatch Office.
- Shorten the processing time of the whole container pickup process.
- So that, the number of tractors inside the yard reduced.


# Comparing with traditional approach:

- Drivers have to park their tractors in the yard.
- Then go to the HIT‚Äôs Dispatch Office to see when and where they should go inside the yard to pickup the container.

---
# Case Study: Container Terminals

# Traditional approach: (Time Comparison)

Drivers need to go to the Dispatch Office

|Lead time:|From tractor to Office ‚Äì 10 min.|
|---|---|
| |Waiting for document ‚Äì 10 min.|
| |Back to tractor ‚Äì 10 min.|
|Total:|30 min.|

Assuming: 500 parking places

Theoretically: Max. number of tractors can be handled = 1,000 tractors (per hour) (60 min/30 min*500 tractor)


# New approach: (Time Comparison)

Drivers just wait in tractor for message

|Lead time:|Time to listen the message: 2 min.|
|---|---|
|Assuming:|500 parking places|
|Theoretically:|Max. number of tractors can be handled = 15,000 tractors (per hour). (60 min/2 min*500 tractor)|

- Mathematically, more tractors can be handled with the same parking capacity.


# Other Advantages of using Mobile technologies:

- Especially when there is typhoons, the tractor drivers can also receive some special information about the operational arrangement before they arrive the Terminal.

# LEARNING TO LEARN

‚ÄòLearning to learn‚Äô is the ability to pursue and persist in learning, to organise one's own learning, including through effective management of time and information, both individually and in groups.

- This competence includes awareness of one's learning process and needs, identifying available opportunities, and the ability to overcome obstacles in order to learn successfully.
- This competence means gaining, processing and assimilating new knowledge and skills as well as seeking and making use of guidance.
- Learning to learn engages learners to build on prior learning and life experiences in order to use and apply knowledge and skills in a variety of contexts: at home, at work, in education and training. Motivation and confidence are crucial to an individual's competence.


# Approaches for learning to learn

1. Diffused and Focused Mode
2. Chunking
3. Over-Learning
4. Recalling
5. Bite-Sized Testing
6. Interleaving
7. Know thyself

---
# 1. Diffused and Focused Mode

- Focused mode: learners concentrate on the material
- Diffused mode: a neural resting state in which consolidation occurs ‚Äî connections between bits of information, and unexpected insights, can occur.

# Pomodoro Technique

- An effective learning session is to take regular breaks by applying the Pomodoro technique. In this technique, we work for 25 minutes, then take a break for 5 minutes.
- The lengths of work and break time can be adjusted depending upon what works best for the learner. But, the most important aspect is to take a regular break.
---

# 2. Chunking

- What we want to learn should be broken into solid chunks of smaller concepts
- The main objective is to learn in mental chunks and all the mental chunks serve as notable puzzle pieces.

# Chunking Technique

For instance, to master a Social Sciences concept, we must also know how to break the concept into mental chunks and how does this concept fit into the larger picture.

- Firstly, survey and priming, which involves scanning the syllabus or book to get an idea of the larger picture.
- Then observe an example.
- Do it yourself and repeat the process in different contexts.
---
# 3. Over-Learning

- We must not spend extra time learning the same material in one sitting.
- Spreading out the learning in different modes and many sessions. It is better to learn a new concept for 30 to 60 minutes each day and gradually increase the depth of learning and skill levels.
- This spaced repetition of concepts will not only lead to successful learning but would also shift the learning to our long-term memory. 6
---
# 4. Recalling

- Spending a few minutes to recall or summarise the topic we are trying to learn.
- It is an effective way to transfer something from short-term learning into long-term memory.
- Also, deliberate practice of recalling concepts in the different physical surroundings can improve learning outcomes and help us understand the concept independent of any physical cues our mind may have.


---
# 5. Bite-Sized Testing

# Illusions

One common obstacle: illusions of Competence

As the material becomes familiar, we gain fluency. Sometimes we feel as if we have ‚Äúunderstood‚Äù a concept, but we don‚Äôt. For instance:

- We may look at an answer and feel that we already know how to come to that solution.
- Underlining or highlighting the most important parts may also result in an illusion of learning. Instead, it is more beneficial to write brief notes summarising the key concepts.

Overcome the illusions of Competence by Bite-Sized Testing:

- Using Bite-Sized Testing as mental tools to assess ourselves.
- Mini-tests are amongst the most useful learning mechanisms that can be accomplished through recalling any concept. Even if we fail to pass this bite-sized testing, we must correct all the mistakes and solidify the learning.
---
# 6. Interleaving

After gaining basic knowledge of the concepts, interleaving can help in mastering the concepts.

- Do not keep working on the same kind of problems for too long
- By practising problems using different practical techniques, we may solidify our knowledge of the concepts and we may learn how to apply these in different situations.
- Knowing how to use a particular concept is an active process, which is as important as knowing when to use it in a learning experience.
---
# 7. Know thyself

- People learn in different ways.
- Those who have ‚Äúracecar brains‚Äù snap up information;
- Those with ‚Äúhiker brains‚Äù take longer to assimilate information but, like a hiker, perceive more details along the way.
- Recognizing the advantages and disadvantages is the first step in learning how to approach unfamiliar material.

# Introduction

- RFID is a kind of technology that use radio waves to automatically identify individual items without a direct line-of-sight automatically.
- Individual item is stored in term of a serial number as identifier in an RFID tag.
- It aims to reduce data entry errors, save manpower, and increase efficiency.
- Essential Components:
- Reader /Writer
- Antenna
- Tag
---

# Working Principle

- Reader Antenna emits radio signals to activate the tag and R/W data to it
- Tag Antenna and Reader Antenna are the conduits between the Tag and the Reader / Programmer
- Antennas allow Reader / Programmer R/W towards the Tag

# Process: 
1. "Smart" Labels are placed on pallets, cartons or individual items.
2. Radio waves transfer data between a reader and a movable item. 
3. An antenna captures the item‚Äôs ID number. 
4. A reader converts the radio waves into digital information. 
5. A host computer provides control over and access to logistical data.

# Using RFID in the Supply Chain

- RFID tags labels embedded with silicon chips.
- Stock items of all sizes, such as products, boxes, and pallets can be attached with RFID tags.
- As they travel through the supply chain network, they can easily be tracked throughout the wireless network environment of the RFID system.
- Any distribution centers and retail stores around the world can act as a check-point to locate the item and synchronize the information to the global central database.

---

# Supply Chain Visibility

RFID enables automatic ID of inventory out of line of sight

- at Dock doors
- Rack and Shelving
- in transit
---

# RFID Readers

An RFID reader is a device that can read from and write data to compatible RFID tags.

A reader has the following main components:

- Transmitter
- Receiver
- Microprocessor
- Memory
- Input/output channels for external sensors, actuators, and annunciators
- Controller
- Communication interface
- Power

---
# RFID Antennas

- A reader communicates to a tag through the antenna, a separate device that is physically attached to a reader, at one of its antenna ports, by means of a cable.
- A single reader can support up to four antennas (that is, have four physical antenna ports).
- An antenna broadcasts the reader transmitter‚Äôs RF signal into its surroundings and receives tag responses on the reader‚Äôs behalf. Therefore, proper positioning of the antennas, not the readers, is essential for good read accuracy.
---
# RFID Readers and Antennas
- Scanner
- Mobile reader
- Reader-embedded glove

---

# RFID Tags

- Inlet is a tag contains IC and antenna
- IC (integrated circuit) provides the memory and stores data
- Antenna harvests power & communicates with the reader
- Inlay is a inlet tag with adhesive layer and acts as label for application

---
# RFID Tag Read and Write

- Additional steps, including initial verification, data erasing, writing new data, and final verification, are required for write operation comparing with read only.
- In addition, the data is written on the tag in blocks in multiple steps.

|Read|Write|
|---|---|
|Requires less energy|Requires more energy|
|Simple step for read operation|Multiple steps for write operation|
|Multiple tags can be read at the same time|Only one tag can be written each time|
|Read range is longer|Write range is shorter|
---

# Types of RFID Tag

# Passive Tag

- Powered by electromagnetic waves energy from reader (no internal battery)
- Smaller, lighter, less expensive
- Almost unlimited life
- Requires higher power from reader

# Active Tag (battery-assisted and true active)

- On-board battery power  
- Greater range but higher cost
- Requires less power from reader
- Finite Life
- Periodically broadcast signals

# Semi-Active Tag (also called a ‚ÄúSemi-Passive Tag‚Äù)

- A ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù tag that uses both beam and battery power.
- The battery power enables the tag to perform functions such as monitoring time and taking periodic temperature readings when it is not in a reader‚Äôs RF field.
- Battery power also greatly enhances the tag‚Äôs read/write range.

# Electronic Product Code‚Ñ¢ (EPC‚Ñ¢)

- The Electronic Product Code‚Ñ¢ (EPC‚Ñ¢) is a numbering scheme designed to uniquely identify all objects.

- An EPC contains
 - a manufacturer identifier
 - a product identifier
 - an item serial number (extra information)

- It was created to enable the electronic connection between physical objects and computer networks ‚Äì to serve as an efficient information reference.

- It can be applied with RFID or current Bar-code system.

# RFID System

# Physical Property

# Antenna Footprint

- The footprints of the reader‚Äôs antennas determine the read zone (also called the read window) of a reader.
- In general, an antenna footprint, also called an antenna pattern, is a three-dimensional region shaped somewhat like an ellipsoid or a balloon projecting out of the front of the antenna.
- In this region, the antenna‚Äôs energy is most effective; therefore, a reader can read a tag placed inside this region with the least difficulty.

# Antenna Polarization

- As discussed previously, an antenna emits electromagnetic waves into its surroundings. The direction of oscillation of these electromagnetic waves is called the polarization of the antenna.

- The main antenna types in UHF, based on polarization, are:

 - Linear polarized
 - Circular polarized

Linear pattern
Circular pattern
---

# Linear vs Circular

- A linear polarized antenna has a narrower radiation beam with a longer read range compared to a circular polarized antenna.
- However, a linear polarized antenna is sensitive to tag orientation with respect to its p
olarization direction.
- A circular polarized antenna has a wider radiation beam and hence reads tags in a wider area compared to a linear polarized antenna.
- Because of the nature of polarization, a circular polarized antenna is largely unaffected by tag orientation.

---

# Tag Orientation (Linear)

# Plane on Which a Tag Can Be Read Properly (Tag Orientation Restricted)

- Legend:
 True: Proper tag alignment and placement resulting in good readability
 ?: Proper tag alignment but indirect placement that may not result in good readability: This can be affected if the tagged object is made (or contains items made of) AF-opaque RF-absorbent materials
 False: Either improper tag alignment or indirect placement = both leading to poor readability,
---

# RF Properties of Different Materials

- Radio waves can be affected by the material through which they propagate.
- A material is called RF-lucent or RF-friendly for a certain frequency if it lets radio waves at this frequency pass through it without any substantial loss of energy.
- A material is called RF-opaque if it blocks, reflects, and scatters RF waves.
- A material can allow the radio waves to propagate through it but with substantial loss of energy. These types of materials are referred to as RF-absorbent.
- The RF-absorbent or RF-opaque property of a material is relative, because it depends on the frequency. That is, a material that is RF-opaque at a certain frequency could be RF-lucent at a different frequency.
